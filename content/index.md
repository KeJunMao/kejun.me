Hey, I'm KeJun. I'm passionate about technology and my favorite languages are <span i-simple-icons-typescript color="#3178c6"></span> TypeScript and <span i-simple-icons-javascript color="#f7df1e"></span> JavaScript. I primarily use <span i-simple-icons-apple></span> MacOS.

I have created several projects such as [<span i-app-logo-ai-anything></span> ai-anything](https://github.com/KeJunMao/ai-anything), [:img-icon{src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/19/PcVLyJD7zNm6bh3.png"} vscode-devtoys](https://github.com/KeJunMao/vscode-devtoys), [:img-icon{src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/19/Fb7lcvrEku98JhH.png"} better-emby-server](https://github.com/KeJunMao/better-emby-server), [:img-icon{src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/08/19/3IaiNYGwW56vD1d.png"} vdraw](https://github.com/KeJunMao/vdraw), and [jekyll-theme-mdui](https://github.com/KeJunMao/jekyll-theme-mdui).
<br>Additionally, I am the team owner of [<span i-app-logo-uni-helper></span> uni-helper](https://github.com/uni-helper) and a team member of [ano-ui](https://github.com/ano-ui), [unocss-applet](https://github.com/unocss-applet), [Akarin](https://github.com/Akarin-project), [mikuorg](https://github.com/MikuOrg), and [mixcm](https://github.com/mixcm).
<br>I have also made contributions to projects like [NuxtUI](https://github.com/nuxtlabs/ui), [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll), [MikuTools](https://imiku.netlify.app/), and [Get.js](https://get.js.org/apps).

In addition to programming, I enjoy playing 🎮 games. Despite being a noob, I regularly play games on platforms like <span i-simple-icons-steam></span> Steam, <span i-simple-icons-nintendoswitch></span> Nintendo Switch, and <span i-simple-icons-playstation></span> PS5.
<br>One of my favorite activities is 🧑‍🍳 cooking with my lovely ❤ wife. We prepare and enjoy every meal together every day. I'm grateful to my wife for always taking care of the dishes.🥹
