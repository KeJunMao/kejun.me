Hey, I'm KeJun. I'm passionate about technology and my favorite languages are <span i-simple-icons-typescript color="#3178c6"></span> TypeScript and <span i-simple-icons-javascript color="#f7df1e"></span> JavaScript. I primarily use <span i-simple-icons-apple></span> MacOS.

I have created several projects such as [<span i-app-logo-ai-anything></span> ai-anything](https://github.com/KeJunMao/ai-anything), [:img-icon{src="https://github.com/veler/DevToys/blob/main/assets/logo/71x71.png?raw=true"} vscode-devtoys](https://github.com/KeJunMao/vscode-devtoys), [:img-icon{src="https://github.com/KeJunMao/better-emby-server/blob/master/docs/logowhite.png?raw=true"} better-emby-server](https://github.com/KeJunMao/better-emby-server), [:img-icon{src="https://github.com/KeJunMao/vdraw/blob/master/public/img/icons/favicon-32x32.png?raw=true"} vdraw](https://github.com/KeJunMao/vdraw), and [jekyll-theme-mdui](https://github.com/KeJunMao/jekyll-theme-mdui).
<br>Additionally, I am the team owner of [<span i-app-logo-uni-helper></span> uni-helper](https://github.com/uni-helper) and a team member of [ano-ui](https://github.com/ano-ui), [unocss-applet](https://github.com/unocss-applet), [Akarin](https://github.com/Akarin-project), [mikuorg](https://github.com/MikuOrg), and [mixcm](https://github.com/mixcm).
<br>I have also made contributions to projects like [NuxtUI](https://github.com/nuxtlabs/ui), [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll), [MikuTools](https://imiku.netlify.app/), and [Get.js](https://get.js.org/apps).

In addition to programming, I enjoy playing games. Despite being a noob, I regularly play games on platforms like <span i-simple-icons-steam></span> Steam, <span i-simple-icons-nintendoswitch></span> Nintendo Switch, and <span i-simple-icons-playstation></span> PS5.
<br>One of my favorite activities is cooking with my lovely wife. We prepare and enjoy every meal together every day. I'm grateful to my wife for always taking care of the dishes.
